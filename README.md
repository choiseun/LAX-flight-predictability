### Summary

We performed time series analysis on LAX air travel in R to (1) predict on-time arrivals and departures with MAPEs of 5.08% and 3.32% and precision measures of 1.216 and 0.954, (2) investigate trends between domestic and international flights, and (3) determine if any external factors contribute to the predictability of on-time arrivals and departures.
